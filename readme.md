# BradioSD K8s Quickstart

Contains all the files and scripts you need to start kubernetes locally or on a k8s remote server.

This is a work in progress. If you feel like you can improve the quickstart in anyway please open an issue and a pull request.

## Steps

### Mac OSX

1. `git clone git@github.com:128BitStudios/bsd-platform.git`
2. `cd ./scripts`
3. `source ./_install.sh`

### Windows

`n/a`

### Linux

`n/a`

## Help areas

1. We need scripts written for Windows.
2. We need scripts written for Linux.
3. We need to get the gateway.yml file working for Minikube if it's possible; we may need to utilize `/etc/hosts` for this to work.
